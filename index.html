        <p>When I was a kid, my father would always tell me about a quote from Abraham Lincoln, "If I had eight hours to chop down a tree, I'd spend six hours sharpening my axe." I have tried to interpret this sentence in multiple ways, and learnings
          from each interpretation have been the driving force for my career. This, coupled with an innate love for understanding Enterprise Applications and the Business process that drives them, set me to pursue a Masters in Management Information
          Systems at J.Mack Robinson College of Business at Georgia State University.</p>
        <p>Now, as I learn the fundamentals of redesigning Business Processes and their implementation in ERP systems, I also keep myself prepared by solving problems using Datastructures and Algorithms. There's undoubtedly yet more to learn, more
          problems to solve, and more to build. And for that, I am very grateful.</p>
        <p>So, if you are looking to fill a Software Engineering/Product Management role, please feel free to contact me at amahendru2@student.gsu.edu or drop me a message on Linkedin.</p>
